          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi There
            <br />

            My name is Atul Singh, and I am currently studying full-stack web
            development. I come from a non-IT background and lack any prior work
            experience in the industry.
            <br />
            I'm committed to keeping up with the most recent tools and
            technologies in the industry as an aspiring MERN stack developer. I
            look for new possibilities to learn and develop all the time. I am
            thrilled to join a group of like-minded individuals and share my
            enthusiasm for web development and problem-solving.
            <br />

            <h3>MERN Project: StudyNotion</h3>
            <p class="projectDescription">
              Now, let me provide a concise overview of the Study Notion
              project:
              <br />
              <b>Technologies Acquired:</b>
              Throughout this venture, I've gained proficiency in a diverse
              array of technologies, including HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS,
              JavaScript, ReactJS, React Router, React Redux Toolkit, Node.js,
              Express.js, MongoDB, and a host of other indispensable React
              dependencies.
              <br />
              <b>Integration Achievements:</b>
              I've seamlessly integrated several key functionalities into the
              project:
              <br />
              <b>- Cloudinary:</b> I've harnessed the power of Cloudinary for
              storing images and videos, enhancing the visual appeal of the
              platform.
              <br />
              <b>- Nodemailer:</b>
              To facilitate user confirmation, I've implemented Nodemailer to
              send confirmation emails. <br />
              <b>- Razorpay Integration:</b>
              To enable seamless payments, I've incorporated Razorpay, ensuring
              a hassle-free payment experience for our users.
              <br />
              <b>Mastery Over Debugging:</b>
              I must admit that this journey wasn't without its challenges.
              However, I'm elated to report that I've successfully debugged a
              remarkable 95% of the code. This experience has not only bolstered
              my coding prowess but has also turned me into a proficient problem
              solver adept at finding solutions to even the most intricate
              issues.
              <br />
              <b>Study Notion Project Highlights:</b>
              Study Notion essentially functions as an Edu-Tech platform, and
              I've meticulously crafted two distinct dashboards to cater to
              different user roles:
              <br />
              <b>Instructor Dashboard:</b>
              This dashboard is exclusively accessible to instructors.
              Instructors can begin by creating an account and then logging in.
              Once logged in, instructors can navigate to the "Add Course" tab,
              where they possess the ability to create, modify, or remove
              courses.
              <br />
              <b>Student Dashboard:</b>
              Designed specifically for students, this dashboard is accessible
              to all enrolled users. Students can enroll in multiple courses,
              allowing them to access a wide array of educational content. The
              dashboard also provides a comprehensive view of course progress,
              enabling students to track their learning journey effectively.
              Students have the opportunity to offer reviews for the courses
              they've enrolled in. Additionally, users retain the option to
              delete their own accounts for added convenience.
              <br />
              <b>Future Enhancements:</b>
              While Study Notion is already brimming with features, my
              commitment to improvement remains unwavering. I'm dedicated to
              enhancing and refining this project, striving to deliver an even
              more impressive version in the near future.
